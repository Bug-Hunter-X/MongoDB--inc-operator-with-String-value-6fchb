# MongoDB $inc operator with String value
This example demonstrates an incorrect usage of MongoDB's `$inc` operator. The `$inc` operator is used to increment a numerical field by a specified value.  However, the provided code attempts to increment a field with a string value, which will likely result in an error or unexpected behavior.

The solution involves ensuring that the value passed to the `$inc` operator is a number.
